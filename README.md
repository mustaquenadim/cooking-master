# Assignment 6 : Cooking Master

Do you know how to cook food? Don't worry! I've created a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript which will provide recipe of any food.

## Description

I've used [The Meal DB](https://www.themealdb.com/) free api providing you recipe.

### How to use this website

Step 1
```
Search your desired meal what you want to cook. Suppose, I want to cook chicken. So I typed the word 'chicken'.
```

```
Wow! I have got many results. That's mean, I could cook more food using chicken.
